## 1. Creating a Snowflake Account

To get started, sign up for a free **Snowflake Trial**.

1. Visit the [Snowflake Sign-Up Page](https://signup.snowflake.com/){:target="_blank"}. And enter your first name, last name, and work email address. Select a reason for signing up, tick if you want to opt out of marketing emails and click **Continue**.

    ![Snowflake Sign-Up Page filled](./assets/screenshots/SnowSignup2.png)

2. Choose your preferred cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or GCP). We prefer AWS for this lab, and also in general this is the most popular choice, since new features are usually released on AWS first. Click **Get Started**.

    ![Snowflake Cloud Provider](./assets/screenshots/SnowSignup3.png)

    !!! warning "Big challenge upcoming"
        Here, a captcha might appear, so you need to solve it to continue.

3. You can either fill the next two forms or skip them. We recommend skipping them for now.

4. Check your email and follow the activation link. It might take a few minutes for the email to arrive.

    ![Snowflake Activation Email Sent](./assets/screenshots/SnowSignup6.png)

    And here it is:

    ![Snowflake Activation Email Received](./assets/screenshots/SnowSignup7.png)

5. Click on the **Click To Activate** button. You will be redirected to the Snowflake login page.

    ![Snowflake Create User](./assets/screenshots/SnowSignup8.png)

    Fill in a username and a password and then confirm. Note down these credentials as you will need them later.

    ![Snowflake Create User Filled](./assets/screenshots/SnowSignup9.png)

    !!! info "Username and password requirements"
        Username must be in letters and numbers.
        The password must contain between 14-256 characters, at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter and one number.

6. You will be redirected to the Snowflake UI. You are now ready to start using Snowflake. Skip this screen for now.

## 3. Creating Databases

For this hands-on lab, we need two databases:
- **PSA** (Persistent Staging Area)
- **ANALYTICS** (Final Data Warehouse)

=== "UI based"
    1. Click on the **Data** tab on the left.

        ![Snowflake Databases](./assets/screenshots/SnowflakeConfig2.png)

    2. Click on the **+ Database** button.

        ![Snowflake New Database](./assets/screenshots/SnowflakeConfig3.png)

    3. Enter the database name (`ANALYTICS` and `PSA`). Then click **Create**.

        ![Snowflake Create Database](./assets/screenshots/SnowflakeConfig4.png)

    4. The new databases have now appeared in the UI.

        ![Snowflake Databases Created](./assets/screenshots/SnowflakeConfig5.png)

    5. Go to the next section.



=== "Code based"
    
    1. Go to **Projects** and then **Worksheets**.

    2. Click on the **+** button on the top right corner to create a new SQL worksheet.

    3. Run the following SQL to create them:
        ```sql
        CREATE DATABASE PSA;
        CREATE DATABASE ANALYTICS;
        ```
        Output from PSA command:
        ![Snowflake Create PSA](./assets/screenshots/SnowflakeConfig6.png)
    4. Verify that the databases have been created:
        ```sql
        SHOW DATABASES;
        ```
    5. You should see the two databases listed. Go to the next section.

## 4. Compute Warehouse Setup

Snowflake uses **virtual warehouses** to process queries. Create a warehouse for this lab:


=== "UI based"
    1. Click on the **Admin Section** tab on the left.

        ![Snowflake Warehouses](./assets/screenshots/SnowflakeConfig7.png)

    2. Select Warehouses and then click on the **+ Warehouse** button on the top right.

        ![Snowflake New Warehouse](./assets/screenshots/SnowflakeConfig8.png)

    3. Enter the warehouse name (`TRANSFORMER`), under **Advanced Options** add 1 for **Suspend After**, and click **Create Warehouse**.

        ![Snowflake Create Warehouse](./assets/screenshots/SnowflakeConfig9.png)

    4. The new warehouse has now appeared in the UI.

        ![Snowflake Warehouse Created](./assets/screenshots/SnowflakeConfig10.png)

    5. Go to the next section.

=== "Code based"
    1. Run the following SQL to create a warehouse named `TRANSFORMER` in a SQL worksheet:

        ```sql
        CREATE WAREHOUSE TRANSFORMER
        WITH WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'XSMALL'
        AUTO_SUSPEND = 60
        AUTO_RESUME = TRUE
        INITIALLY_SUSPENDED = TRUE;
        ```

        This ensures:

        **Cost Efficiency** → Auto-suspends when not in use.  
        **Performance** → Automatically resumes when queries are executed

    2. Verify that the warehouse has been created:

        ```sql
        SHOW WAREHOUSES;
        ```
    3. You should see the new warehouse listed. Go to the next section.
